# Nashville Crime and Community Resources Analysis

## Description

### Key Question: How is crime in Nashville affected by community amenities and resources?

This project is a comprehensive look at arrests, greenspace, and short term rentals in Nashville or Davidson County and how the latter two factors may influence arrests. It is primarily focused on geospatial visualizations in combination with traditional data visualizations.

Most of the data for this project can be found in the Nashville Open Data Portal by searching for the following topics: police department incidents, greenways, park trails, short term rentals. I also included a map of police precincts to separate Nashville into colloquially understood areas and names.
